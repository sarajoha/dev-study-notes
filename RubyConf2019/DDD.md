Domain driven design (DDD)

1. Big picture

    Domain will guide the design.

    Domain is how the company works or does their business
    Eg ecormerce ecosystem

    Is NOT
    - business language
    - a way of making things is code

    Ubiquitous language. It is common language between users and developers. Shared knowledge.

2. Why practice DDD

    - code maintenance gets easier
    - more efficient development, everyone is on the same page

    Starting with good design will slow you down but it pays off in the long term

3. Identify current situation of business

    - CRUD solution
    - startup doing an MVP
    - more than 30 features
    - too many people and features to manage


    How to start building ubiquitous language?

    - Gather domain experts
    - Glossary of terms
    - Find common knowledge
    - Document flows from product and technical point of view
    - Use tools to analyze code (source level, rubocop)
    - Analyze software metrics
    - Make an organized mess 

4. Start DDD with strategic modeling
    - Gives boundaries
    - Clear definitions
    - Bounded contexts are about business intentions

5. Questions during planning

    - How many resources already exists and can be used?
