Rails core team in GitHub
- Upgrading Rails in GitHub

2008-2009 GitHub forked Rails,
Custom code just for GitHub. 

Rails 3.0 was much slower than 2.0

2009 GitHub tried to upgrade to 3.0, it was hard and it stalled in 2012. Dog in fire meme, this version is fine.

GitHub adopted multiple Rails versions in different environments.

2018 first time in 4 years that GitHub had the most recent Rails version, no fork.

**Upgrading is costly but the cost of not Upgrading is immeasurable. The technical debt accumulates.** 

When you don't upgrade
- Development is painful
- Hiring is harder
- Dependencies are brittle

When upgrading you should:
- Build a team
- Take time to make a plan
- Fix deprecation warnings early
- Plan for the future
                                
Please don't fork Rails

You can pay technical debt incrementally, you don't have to do it all at once.

The payoff is worth it!

Reasons for upgrading to new versions of Rails:
- Improved APIs
- Security features
- Better performance
- New libraries
- A chance to contribute
